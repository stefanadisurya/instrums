It is an iOS app to help people identify music instrument sounds through mini quiz. The rules are very simple, you just have to score 10 to finish the quiz. The technologies behind Instrums are just the basic stuff of Swift, namely:
- :iphone: UIKIt
- :trumpet: AVFoundation
- :books: CoreData
- :woman_dancing: CoreAnimation

The app still have some bugs on the constraint, please kindly do a pull request if you want to contribute to the project.
